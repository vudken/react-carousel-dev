# react-carousel-dev

I'm glad to see you at my repository for React based development!

This repository was built for small and simple slider/carousel with:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Navigation dots to navigate through certain slides with more convinient way.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Navigation arrows for desktop users navigation.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Animated and responsive css.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Infinite mode feature. (Scroll slides endlessly)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Supports swipes.

To check how does it work just go to:
